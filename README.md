# Code-Snippets

This repo contains tested snippets for some frequently used Data structures and Algorithms.

The snippets are maintainable and easy to use. 

I have added some sample usage and problems link too for reference.

The repo is public and will be very useful for you to revise Basic Data structures - 1 course of Unacademy taken by me.
